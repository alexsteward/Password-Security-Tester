# Vulnerability Tester

## Overview
The **Vulnerability Tester** is designed to simulate brute-force attacks on hashes generated by popular algorithms like **MD5**, **SHA-1**, and **SHA-256**. By inputting a hashed password, selecting the hash type, and specifying a maximum password length, the tool attempts to find the original plaintext password. This tool serves as an educational resource for understanding vulnerabilities and learning how to protect systems against password cracking.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for ethical and educational use only. It should not be used for any unauthorized or malicious activities. Always ensure you have explicit permission before testing any system or network.

## Features
- **Supports Multiple Hash Types**: MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.
- **Customizable Cracking Limit**: Define the maximum password length to control the range of brute-forcing.
- **Efficient Cracking**: Uses a brute-force method to generate potential password combinations based on the provided `passwords.txt` file.

## Tools, Languages, and Libraries Used
- **Python** – Primary programming language used for the tool.
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** – Development environment for building and testing the code.
- **hashlib** – Python's built-in library for generating and checking hash values.
- **time** – Used for calculating and displaying cracking duration.

## Skills Learned
- **Hashing Algorithms:** Gained hands-on experience working with MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 to understand their weaknesses and how they can be exploited in password cracking.
- **Password Protection Awareness:** Learned to defend against password cracking by identifying weaknesses in hashing algorithms and implementing stronger password policies and encryption methods.
- **Python Scripting:** Developed skills in Python for file handling, hashing, and performing computational tasks efficiently.
